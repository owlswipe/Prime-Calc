## The Calculator
The calculator in Prime Calc is easier to use than other calculators, with <b>automatic decimal-to-fraction conversion</b> (so you'll know that 0.07692307692 is equal to 1/13), <b>tap-to-undo</b> (never fear tapping the wrong button again, just go back one button press), <b>a fully-viewable stack</b> (so you can see exactly what you just calculated, and make sure it's mistake-free), and <b>really big buttons</b>, so your finger hits what you want it to hit.

## The Today Widget
With a single swipe down from the top of your screen you will find Prime Calc's today widget, where you can easily calculate without unlocking your iPhone/iPad and without leaving the app you are in.

## The Tip Calculator
The tip calculator introduced in Prime Calc v2.0 allows for easy splitting of bills and calculating tips based on %s.

## The Fraction Calculator
Add, subtract, multiply, or divide two fractions, then tap a button to put the result into the calculator for easy multi-step calculations.

## The Factor Calculator
Instantly find out if a number is prime, and find out all of its factors.

## Compare numbers
Type in two numbers and you can compare them, and find their GCD and LCM. (Unfortunately, we have not yet uploaded this feature's code to Github; if you want it, please <a href="mailto:one.studio@outlook.com">email me</a> to request it.)
